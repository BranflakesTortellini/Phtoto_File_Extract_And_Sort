File Management Script
This script is designed to help you manage and organize your files by performing various operations such as transferring files, removing duplicates, and verifying files. The script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system
Required Python packages: os, shutil, tkinter, tqdm, datetime, logging
Setup
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Install the required Python packages by running the following command in your terminal:
Copy code
pip install tqdm
Save the script to a file with a .py extension, for example, file_management_script.py.
Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
Run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python file_management_script.py
The script will launch a graphical user interface (GUI) to guide you through the file management process.
Features
Transfer Files
This script allows you to transfer files from a source directory to a destination directory. It traverses through subdirectories and moves all the files to the destination directory.

Select the source directory by clicking on the "Select Directory to Search" button.
Select the destination directory by clicking on the "Select Output Directory" button.
Click on the "Transfer Files" button to initiate the transfer process.
A progress bar will display the status of the file transfer.
Remove Duplicate Files
This script can identify and remove duplicate files from a directory. It compares files based on their sizes and extensions to determine duplicates.

After transferring files using the "Transfer Files" feature, the script automatically checks for duplicate files in the destination directory.
Duplicate files are removed, and information about the removed duplicates is saved in a text file named "removed_duplicates.txt" in the destination directory.
Verify Files
You can verify the integrity of the transferred files using this script. It performs a verification process on the files to ensure they are intact and unchanged.

After removing duplicate files, the script automatically verifies the remaining files in the destination directory.
A progress bar shows the status of the verification process.
Possible Duplicates
After transferring files and removing duplicates, the script moves any remaining files from the source directory to a "Possible Duplicates" directory within the original directory. It also removes empty directories.

Logging
The script logs its actions and errors to a file named application.log in the script's directory. You can review this log file to track the script's progress and any encountered errors.

Note
The script uses the tqdm library to display progress bars for file transfer and verification processes.
The GUI allows you to select directories using a file dialog for convenience.
Example
Run the script using the provided instructions.
Select the source directory and destination directory.
Click the "Transfer Files" button to initiate the file transfer.
The script will display the progress of the transfer process.
After the transfer, the script will remove duplicate files and save the details in the "removed_duplicates.txt" file.
The script will then verify the transferred files.
Finally, it will move any remaining files to the "Possible Duplicates" directory and remove empty directories.
