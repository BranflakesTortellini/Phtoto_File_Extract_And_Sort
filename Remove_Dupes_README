Duplicate File and Folder Remover
This script is designed to help you identify and remove duplicate files and folders within a specified directory. It utilizes file attributes such as file size and file type to identify duplicates and removes them from the directory. Additionally, the script removes empty directories.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system
Required Python packages: os, tkinter
Setup

The script will remove duplicate files and folders, as well as any empty directories within the selected directory.
The script will display a success message indicating that duplicate files and folders have been removed, including empty folders.
Note
The script uses the Tkinter library to provide a file dialog for selecting the target directory.
The script identifies duplicates based on the presence of the word "copy" in the file name or an enumeration like " (1)" or " (2)" at the end of the file name.
Duplicate files and folders are removed, while unique files and folders are preserved.
Empty directories are removed after the duplicate removal process.
