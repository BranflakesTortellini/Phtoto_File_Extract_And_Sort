# Duplicate File and Folder Remover (Remove_Dupes.ipynb)

This script helps you remove duplicate files and folders within a specified directory. It scans the directory and its subdirectories, identifying duplicates based on file names and attributes such as file size and type. The script removes duplicate files and folders, including any resulting empty directories.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Required Python packages: `os`, `tkinter`

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `Remove_Dupes.ipynb` file.
3. Open the notebook file.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the script.
5. The script will prompt you to select a directory using a file dialog.
6. After selecting the directory, the script will scan it and its subdirectories to identify duplicate files and folders.
7. Duplicate files with names containing the word "copy" or an enumeration will be removed.
8. Duplicate files with matching attributes (size and type) will be removed, keeping only one copy.
9. Duplicate folders will be removed, including any resulting empty directories.
10. Once the process is complete, duplicate files and folders will be removed from the selected directory.

## Note
